**Titanic: Machine learning from disaster**
================================

This project consist of the to create a model to predict which passengers will survive, according to a providing dataset. Firstly, i 
cleaned up my data, and i've create a features ready to be used in my ML model, then, i've used a decision tree classifier from sklearn lib.
The obtained results were awesome, consider that's my first time with Kaggle and ML world.


That's my [profile](https://www.kaggle.com/pcoelho07) in the Kaggle platform.
